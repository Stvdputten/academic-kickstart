Every Wednesday is my off-day. I'm free to do whatever I like. Assignments need to be finished in the weekend, so no hurry. All my lectures are on Monday and Tuesday, everything has passed and in some way I have an extremely long weekend. (ignoring the mentoring on Friday though).

What do I do with this gift of free time? Well actually some friends of mine decided to chill at my place. We are currently talking about starting a (dutch) podcast. It's called mosselkletsen, which means clam talking. It is some sort of sexual gay women reference apparently. I have no experience, but they did tell me my voice is nice to listen to. I never thought my stem was nice. The goal seems nice to setup and I get a few extra reasons to drink through the week. So that is 1 thing that happened.

Furthermore I do notice that meta-cognition stays an interesting topic. I'm currently trying to work on a book (actually just copy one) to study smart. My goal is to motivate our students to perform better with the help of awareness and recognizing their study goals (if at all). 

Which brings me to my next experience on this productive Wednesday. When talking about my meta-cognition and teaching children to learn an Indian friend of mine who cooked for me (shout out) told me about Ken Robinson. He talks about why (high school) students are such demotivated and why the system doesn't work. We are killing creativity by standardization and using Ritalin to calm the overstimulated children (in a nutshell). How does this knowledge effect me? Well I need to level with the children at my tutoring job, so knowing a reason which might demotivate them help me to do my job a little bit better.

I'm still figuring this blogging thing out, however I did learn about a new tool called quizlet and saw a lot of infographics about *zhe greatest tools* to learn. The most succesful learning strategies in a nutshell. Number 1 retrieval practice or self-testing 80% improvement. Number 2 is distributed practice (learning over time), short rehearsal session every week. And the following elaborative interrogation (linking chunks), self-explanation, interleaved practice. Avoid Highlighting/rereading/summarizing. Peace out.
