<p>In this edition of my weekly updates: Anger, Fear, Won-ton soup, Rejection and Resurrection. Will Stephan Survive? Well yes otherwise I wouldn’t be writing now. So let’s start with the boring stuff.</p>
<p>The most time spent this week was to get back up to date with my statistics course. Statistics still sucks and the book is unnecessarily complicated. I decided to use the introductions/dummy books instead. That’s the main take away for myself this week.</p>
<p>So have you ever had a moment where someone was just unreasonably acted towards you. Like this person hates you, without seemingly any reason? Well I was in the library minding my own business and just enjoying my time. Well the personal in the library I visit always seem the chase away students 15 minutes before the actual closing time. So I was just finishing some stuff and like 8 min before closing time the guard just came to me and passive aggressively asked if I would hurry up. I responded that there was enough time, which he countered with saying I should not be cutting corners. I was literally packing my stuff to leave and not be hasty because there was enough time, so telling me I should hurry up really hit a nerve. While still packing I looked around and when the guard noticed that he again came back to just angrily look at me so that I would hurry. Well that was a moment I felt a little bit scared, but my natural reaction to that feeling is the become angry. I wanted to hit him in the face, so much. Anyways being the polite person I am, I walked past him wished him a good night and returned home. Afterwards I wrote an online complaint to the library about 1) the guards behavior 2) to tell that the 11 pm closing time is actually 15 min earlier.</p>
<p>I got a subscription to Audible. There are a lot of books that are just hard to follow when listening. One noticeably exception is Barack Obama’s new book, the promised land. Basically I got the book because I wanted something that I could listen to rather than having a great story with a horrible story teller. So far I have listened 3 chapters, which is a lot, because Barack has the best voice to listen to ever and a great story. Absolutely a recommended listen.</p>
<p>Through the week I actually did not have a lot of pressing stuff. I took a lot of the tutoring days for my company to actually tutor. It was really nice, we have a new rule about phone usage and that was met with enough resistance. It’s hard to know when you got the correct relation with your students. I belief one should not be to friendly because that will create a friend group rather than a study group, I prefer the later. Furthermore having new rules gives a clear overview for the students how to approach us and where our boundaries are. With these rules we can hopefully help them to improve their school results. Only 3 weeks remaining till Christmas, so we want to bring out the best of them for the remaining year.</p>
<p>A few more things, I went walking this week again with my good friends Femke and Michelle. Started my sport week at Sportja. Bought a lot of food (huel). Black Friday was yesterday. The orange cat from the street slept at my house all day and left in the evening, today. Oh yeah the good news is that I got a respons back form the library personal and they apologised, said the guard was usually nice but had some personal issues and would be personally taken care of by the respondent. Furthermore the library personal will be reminded that 11 o’clock is the closing time not a minute earlier. Happy me.</p>
<p>Coming week my sister will stay over, so stay tuned about that. Furthermore I will be working a lot on my master thesis, starting with finally getting the benchmarks running. That will be my weekend. Have a nice week.</p>
