<p>Oh boy where to begin. I got a new laptop. A macbook air 2020, who would have thought that? I’m pretty sure I don’t want to do a PhD. I got 3 weeks to finish everything. I dodged some taxes, I received a lot of bonus money, I had my first shot of pfizer, my company is going to talk about a offer to work with a school. SGDQ started. I’m still keeping these posts short. My previous laptop is on the brink of death.</p>
