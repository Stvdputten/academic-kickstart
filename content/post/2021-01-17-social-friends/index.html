<p>When looking back I can only guess how peoples lives are compared to mine. Why would I want to compare it? The benefits are knowing where you stand and know what you lack or should bring attention to. On the other hand, who ever is happy knowing they lack stuff.</p>
<p>Once again my sister was on visit this week. Poor girl lacks a home and has to visit me. I like it when she visits, it is actually great and I don’t get bored. Although it is harder to be strict and have self-control when shes around which leads to us enjoying the occasional delights of sugary meals.</p>
<p>Today I finished star wars the clone wars TV show, which is great. Highly recommended. It always gives me a thrill when I’m watching a good show, goosebumps etc. It feels like a media that can never stop giving you a catharsis or at least something to feel alive again. I guess that might be why horror might be one of my favorite genres because the suspension and spookiness makes you feel alive.</p>
<p>In times of Corona it feels weird meeting a lot of friends. So this week I had multiple friends visit me, me visiting friends and even a online meet-up with an old contact. As a twenty plus year old student, the rules start to make less sense and feel overboard. No one wants to say what should be done but only what feels politically correct. People won’t think about the real consequences of the lockdown, or at least some are but most just blindly follow the things our government order which is logical. I also am one of that, but I’m not sure if I should be skeptical or just read more about why the vaccine is bad or this lockdown. Only the future will tell how right or wrong we were.</p>
<p>Anyways things that I learned this week, I like meeting up with people and I have a lot of free time so I should be able to enjoy that also. I bought persona 5 Royals, jesus I want to play that badly. I have to lend a PS4 because I don’t have any. Wish me luck.</p>
