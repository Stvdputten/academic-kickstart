I have Covid ... Well not really actually. As the title might suggest a moment of silence for the people that have it and do suffer from it. The news just makes everyone scared and in my opinion should just be ignored. This week cases of Covid in the Netherlands are surging. Coincidentally I feel sick, so I might have Covid or just a bad cold. My appointment is Monday the 12th, so let's hope for the best. 

It all started on Sunday, oh what a night. I invited a friend, we did some homework together. Afterwards we drank whiskey and I think I went to bed around 3 am? Really nice, however he forgot that he was actually sort of sick and that might be where everything started. So here I am, feeling sick starting from Monday. Slowing creeping up and still sort of sick. The worst thing about it, is the sleep quality. If there is one thing I really like, it is sleep. So yeah, bad week.

I brought some groceries to a friend who got sick and potentially had Covid (turned out to be negative). She just doesn't keep a lot of food in her house. I currently have enough (liquid) food to feed myself for a few months. If you ever heard of [HUEL](nl.huel.com), they are a nutritionally complete food provider. Basically shakes that "fill you up" and tries to brand itself as a healthy fast-food provider. It started as an experiment, however I still eat it regularly because healthy fast-food is better than unhealthy fast-food. After 1.5 years it is relatively cheap given that you get a complete meal (skip that 1 dollar mcdonald's burger). I would say my benefits are:
- Easy to count calories 
- Reasonably cheap
- Fast-food
- Feel less inclined to eat unhealthy shit (and when you do you enjoy it less)
- Invest the "saved" money in luxurious meals
- *VEGAN*
- Can be stored up to 1 year (useful when covid started)
- Cheap alternative when going on vacation (e.g. ski-ing) to the expensive stores there
- Free shirt
- Easy to create multiple batches
- Feel healthy (This might just be placebo)

There are some drawbacks:
- Farts when you start out (because you got a relative large amount of proteins) 
- *Detox* and notice your sugar addiction through headaches
- Hard to digest when you start out
- Need to clean immediately (food get hard)
- Only really nice when cold
- Requires blender
- Eating liquid food is not so socially accepted and frowned upon
- Doesn't feel nice to eat when you have a hangover

On Wednesday when I started feeling ill, I had to cancel my plans. No tutoring, except they online meeting. So for my master thesis I spoke to assistant professor A. Uta, who is an expert on distributed systems and performance evaluation. We met up thursday in a voice call and it sort of felt like he was trying to sell me his project. Which is actually really nice, I feel like I cant learn a lot from him. The begin vibes were great and I do want to continue working with him. Most likely the thesis will focus on benchmarking microservices or serverless functions on existing cloud platforms. The goal is to find a methodology to benchmark these services and compare multiple cloud services and correctly evaluate the services. Well it seems some statistics is involved, so that's nice. The thing that most stood out was his question, "What are you goals". It seems to indicate to me that he wants to help me achieve my goals and he even offered a roadmap. Should I look further or simply accept that this guy is great? I give it a 95% chance that I will do my thesis with him. 


I also feel like I got my mojo back. Like that thing you get when you drop in a sort of flow? The talk with my potential thesis supervisor gave me a lot of energy to continue and work on other assignments. Furthermore my student coach shared some really nice articles about teaching how to learn and such a well written article that gave me a lot of insight on how I should teach students. Coincidentally I invited her to the Study Smart lecture I will have on Thursday. It almost feels like I organized a guest lecture incidentally.

So I'll probably report again when I got my test results back, until then anonymous reader!
