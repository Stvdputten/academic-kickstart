<p>With only … 7 weeks to go. I can feel the end nearing. I had a few busy days trying to learn for my last exam, it was a very doable exam. I only need to push through. While I can taste victory, I need to accept that these remaining few weeks will make or break.</p>
<p>I have until Wednesday to turn in my first experiments part. I can and will push through to do it. The importance of sleep can’t be understated. the book I read gives four important and underestimated influences on your sleep. Alcohol, blue light, temperature and natural light. Now let’s see what I can do with it.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that I’m relaxed. No real stress and I don’t know why. Could it be that I know I have my future in hands? Well I’m not sure yet. I don’t have a lot to talk about this week. I’ve skipped the gym more times, than I would like, but that’s okay. I drank more alcohol and ate unhealthy, but that’s okay.</p>
<p>Let’s have a change of mindset (lazy) and make this a week to remember. No pressure, just go and keep the steps going. If the end thesis is there. I can relax.</p>
