<p>Next week will be an important week. I have lot’s of things to do and two deadlines. If I can make it work. Who knows. So let’s get it going.</p>
<p>Do you also find it funny when you think of an friend you haven’t spoken in a few months and briefly after that they message you? Well that’s how I got one friend of mine Thomas. It’s a curious experience. Maybe it’s all in my head, but I do want to note that it happens!</p>
<p>I believe habits are important, that’s why I read books about it all the time. Especially the book “Atomic Habits” has given great non-standard advice how to optimize your habits. I’m currently trying to take advantage of that. I do belief I got lot’s of things in my day to do because of that, that’s why my more essential stuff get’s lost in it. Bringing myself to a point that’s worse. However I also think that risks have to be taken and accumulated debts by focusing time into my new habits instead of primary tasks will pay off in the long run. One example of habit stacking (building habits upon existing habits) is my routine of stretching after working out. I start to feel flexible already! Everyone 1% improvement, will pay off in its compounded interest. Let’s see if that holds in a few months.</p>
<p>MOOCs are also great things to use for acquiring new skills. In regards to studying faster (which everyone always can acquire) I started to learn from a website called Futurelearn. Nice things and a great addition to popular MOOCs such as learning how to learn. Go look it up!</p>
<p>This year I spent my Kingsday rather boringly alone. On one side I could have enjoyed the festivities outside, on the other hand I still belief having some constraint in this last phase of covid is important. It feels dumb to not relax when everyone is literally partying outside. I can have it for now. However I should start to work on enjoying my free time more.</p>
<p>Okay so a few new things with regards to productivity. I’m currently speed reading a lot of books, especially the ones that have been on my reading list for way too long. How do I solve this problem? Well I’m planning on reading two books each week. I started with Hooked (Nir Eyal) and the 4-hour workweek (Timothy Ferris). Both great books in some regards, however I did not like the workweek book that much. The reason is mostly likely that it feels dated and really American, but the essence still holds true. If I would summarize Hooked in one sentence it would be: To get people hooked you have to optimize the hooked formula which consists of four part, the cue, the action on the cue, the variable reward of the action and the investment that people make. Four hour work week would be summarized by: You can have a shorter work week when you deal, define, eliminate, automate, liberate your goals by being a (dick) assertive person and stopping your self imposed limits.</p>
<p>I’ll get back to my important tasks now. If there’s one way I’m dealing with most of my stress it would be because of (almost) daily exercise I’m getting. I’m trying to live with a calorie deficit so let’s see how that goes. Did you know that stopping with habits is really hard? It’s basically because habits can’t be unlearned, but you have to create new association in your brain.</p>
<p>One last thing I learned this week. I watched a video about why eating meat isn’t as bad as one might think. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGG-A80Tl5g&amp;t=5s">Eating less Meat won’t save the Planet. Here’s Why.</a> I like stuff like this because it remind me that there’s always more perspective and not to take everything on face value.</p>
