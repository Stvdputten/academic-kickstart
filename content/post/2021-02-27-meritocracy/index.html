<p>Those that work hardest should receive the most. Sometimes I feel like I’m working a lot, but I’m not receiving enough back. What do I mean with that? I’ll elaborate a bit more this week.</p>
<p>I should state that this week has been both boring and exhilarating. At the start of the week everything of my thesis starting to workout. Although I got stuck at the start of the week, I pressed through and got a lot of progress. While also really enjoying the stuff I was trying out. I was stuck on the infrastructure deployment scripts, but now I got multiple running scripts (thanks to some random guy who was able to figure it on github, thank you anon). I still have a lot of things to get done before I can say I got where I want to be, but I’m getting closer and closer. I guess we learn by pushing through.</p>
<p>After thinking about it a lot, I think I need some other cloud provider to get my project going. I might need to involve my supervisor rather sooner than later to achieve this. If I’m stuck I can also ask my fellow students.</p>
<p>The only thing is that I have been doing so much, but when will I reap the benefits? I keep on learning and improving my coding, but sometimes it feels like it’s never enough. What more? Keep healthy, eat enough. Sleep enough. Code daily. Workout daily. What are the costs? I do feel like my relationships with friends suffer. Missing a girlfriend. Basically I have no social life here. I would love to blame corona for this, but even if corona wasn’t here my social life would not improve that much either. Sounds like the typical computer nerd — maybe I am.</p>
<p>I have a few promises noted in my post of 6 Feb. I’ll summarize the relevant ones. The remaining objectives are:</p>

<p>I keep an active routines if I might say so myself. Only a few things which I would like to improve upon. It seems only four major “goals” are left. I’ll have to add some soon. Something like keeping up the 9 to 17 routine. Clean my house more. Anyways it seems I made quite some progress! On a positive note, I’ve been exercising enough for the last two weeks. I have also been reading a lot. Let’s keep that going.</p>
