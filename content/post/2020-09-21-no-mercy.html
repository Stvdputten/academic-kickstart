<p>Hi, sorry for this late post anonymous reader. I had a busy week, which gives me extra reason to relax. The title, by the way, is a reference to Cobra Kai the Netflix serie. The serie is the sequel to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087538/">The Karate Kid</a> trilogy. I have not seen all of them, but I do use the theme to get myself motivated, so listen to it when you feel down. Anyways my usual summary of the week will follow below.</p>
<p>I took a break of sporting, because by elbow still sort of hurts from boxing a few weeks ago. Never try to hit something as hard as you can and fail keeping your muscles tight. Oh a lot has happened so let’s use a checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
Have a drink with mentees (and go way 2 hard).</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
Get clarity about my job as mentor.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
Friends randomly dropping by drunk and whatever.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
Watch awesome series during a hangover.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
Visit the student association again (and get drunk).</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
Go drink with my podcast mates.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Watch the movie Miller’s Crossing and understand the movie.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
Finish my assignment one hour before the deadline on Sunday.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Get paid to create an easy static website (at least I got the job).</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
Enjoy the sun and visit a silent disco for old people.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
Clean my house in the morning on Monday.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
Plan a Zoom meeting with a professional organization about teaching students how to learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>I really do not understand statistics, it feels like the harder I try to understand it the harder it gets to be understood. More people probably feel that way. So maybe I should try to work on that, asking for help it hard.
It seems a lot of preparation should be performed for my Master thesis so I should start working on that. I did not finish my Anki retrieval cards this week. I am halfway through The 7 Deadly Sins. I did not read or get a lot of work done on my android develop/java career. My tutoring company still needs to be worked upon.</p>
<p>This week is going to be a little bit different. I’m going to create a list again, but this should be what I expect to do this week.</p>
<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Complete ASC before sunday.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Complete Java book.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Halfway through Flutter.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Got to the gym again.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
SEO of my website.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Transition to new host.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Attend Master Class.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Do a 1-1 with the mentees.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Ankify my courses.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Start working on my Master Thesis prep (call Bas).</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Perform a good homework tutoring session.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Prepare the Tutoring Session workbook.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Do not have a hangover.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Meditate each day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay it seems like a lot. However it’s also a nice challenge. See you again next week.</p>
