<p>As is tradition, I want to start my first blog post with Hello World! My name is Stephan and I have been interested in many nerdy stuff since I was young. One of my characteristics is to try new stuff, which led me to create my first personal blog.</p>
<p>A little bit about myself, I’m currently a last year graduate student of University Leiden of the computer science Msc track. <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/" class="uri">https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/</a> Check it out! I’m half dutch-half phillipine and raised in the Netherlands.
I have multiple hobbies that include but are not limited to: reading, go to the gym, watch the tv/movie classics, try new stuff, develop, self-improve, learning.
My jobs are currently student coach at the university, (co)-owner of <a href="https://www.sesstudiehuis.nl">SES Studiehuis</a> and being a full-time student (I see it as a job).</p>
<p>I hope to use this blog to keep track of what I learn and do this year. Maybe note down some useful stuff that I learn along the way. A quick expectation of coming year goal:</p>
