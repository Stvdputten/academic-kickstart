<p>The titles of my weekly posts aren’t always relevant to the content. I’m basically just journaling about whatever I feel like. I think that is actually the goal, but I realized the disparity of my content and title just now. Time for the usual talk about my week.</p>
<p>First time a family member I knew got corona. Was weird to feel worried for a small moment. Luckily nothing severe, she did have the symptoms but is recovering. In her case just symptoms of a fever. Can’t imagine my family member dying, but these thoughts do through your mind. Especially when my uncle visited me this week and I was in contact with a lot of people the night before.</p>
<p>Met up with my supervisor of my thesis subject. He looked as I expected him to look, very nice. We took a walk in front of the university building and afterwards we talked a little in his office. When I entered, the guard tried stop us but we just ignored her and walked onward while she sort of muttered the words.. " but you aren’t allowed to meet-up". It was nice. During my trip to the building on my bike I noticed how out of shape I am. I immediately bought a gym subscription, no joke.</p>
<p>Note to myself. Stopped biting my nails already for 2 weeks, they still look ugly as fuck.</p>
<p>Well this was week 2 of trying to get into the flow of 9-17. I don’t seem to be that productive, but maybe I need to change my point-of-view or get more motivated. So coincidentally a friend recommended a nice book about the miracles of the morning ritual. I am aware of the habits in general and I do consider myself well disciplined w.r.t. my morning ritual. But still a nice refresher. So what did I think about my habits after reading the book. I haven’t tried is Eating my Frogs first in the morning and I stopped doing exercise. Both very important, so I’ll do that again. You’ll hear about it next week.</p>
