<p>A secret discipline called living. The paradox is that living life is giving life. What does that mean? I don’t know. But for a second I had you thinking and that is always important. So now back to my weekly doses of writing.</p>
<p>Yes, I finally finished my first course of the semester (pending the final grade). After extending the deadline 3 days and finally an extra afternoon, which I complimented with an all nighter to be sure of my success, I turned my paper in. I feel relieved, although only a little bit. I made it through while my sister was visiting during the weekdays, she cooked for me and herself. We ate a lot of sweets.</p>
<p>I got hooked on this game called AFK Arena, huge waste of my time but I enjoyed spending it. I watched the TV show Blood of Zeus, 8/10.</p>
<p>Tuesday was the last day of my gym subscription. Bye bye Newstyle, hello new opportunities. I did see some gyms that offer nice temporary try outs, even some that offered 1 free week of try outs. I should probably try out one sooner than later. It helps relief stress, keep my weight on a good level and finally some reason to out of house at a regular interval. Wednesday and Thursday were the days that I turned in my paper and slept for only 2 hours (I worked both days). On Friday I worked towards my other deadlines. So many deadlines. If memory serves me right, November and December have always been busy for myself. Old deadlines to finish, new deadlines to finish. I just have to hang on for a last time.
I have 5 study goals, 4 of them are completing my four remaining courses (1/5th done). One is to start my master thesis. Let’s see how it goes.</p>
<p>That’s all for this week. I can rant on about a lot of stuff, but I’d rather focus on the nicer things that are coming up. Which I’ll discuss next week.</p>
