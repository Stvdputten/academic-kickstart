<p>Dear diary, today is Saturday. The day that I write whatever happened in my last week and try to reflect on my week. First I learned a lot this week. I cracked the code and finally finished my book. Furthermore I got my board year financial compensation. What will I do with the money? Finally I’ll just write about the first thing that comes to my mind to finish the day.</p>
<p>This week has been quite the experience. I got to work on a lot of technologies. One thing that does help me. When I’m learning and I feel that I don’t know something well, while I should. I just write the term or idea down and look it up later with Youtube video’s. This easy way fills some gaps in my knowledge. So I finally understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kubernetes (Reading and online tutorial helped)</li>
<li>Docker (Online tutorial helped)</li>
<li>Started with Terraform (Intro)</li>
<li>Learned that Scala is the best paid language</li>
<li>Cassandra (Deploying on Kubernets)</li>
<li>Tmux (Read the book)</li>
<li>Cloud providers cli: gcloud/aws/az</li>
<li>Flask (Creating quick front-end for an app)</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically I’m trying to expand my knowledge of the cloud native landscape. I should probably develop more apps, because DevOps is nice but it is still supportive of the actual app development or do some more open-source contributions.</p>
<p>I can’t remember much from last week. It felt like I wasted a lot of days. I woke up late (10-12 am) and when I finally got going I went to work at 15. In the evening I don’t do much. One way I handled my laziness was by using more passive mediums, like audible to read my books. I finally finished ‘The Silmarillion’. I had that back already for 6 years.</p>
<p>Next up I suddenly received an update on my financial bonus for my board year. I got 2.1k. Nice! What should I do with that money? I have some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy a bike</li>
<li>Buy a desktop</li>
<li>Buy some raspberry pi’s for server stuff</li>
<li>Get a driver’s license</li>
<li>Upgrade my current home with some much needed interior</li>
<li>Buy a new laptop</li>
<li>Safe it for later</li>
<li>Invest a bit</li>
<li>Pay off some debts</li>
<li>Cloths</li>
<li>Bigger TV</li>
<li>Vacation</li>
<li>Nothing</li>
<li>Pet</li>
<li>Girlfriend</li>
<li>Invest in my work</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Gym subscription</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah so please contact me if you have some good ideas. Not sure what money should get me these days. Last time I had over 1k on my bank account was when I started studying. Living is expensive, but buying cheap is sometimes also expensive.</p>
<p>I want to finish this week with a small quote I got from a TV show:
A lesson learned is a lesson earned.</p>
