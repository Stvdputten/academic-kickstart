With only ten weeks remaining I propose to use this blog for my personal countdown. What are my biggest worries and what must I achieve to get through these rowdy last few weeks. Although sporting and having some relaxing stuff to do is also important. I should just disregard anything that isn't helping me achieve my end goal of graduating. 

First off I need to finish my remaining course stuff. That means:
-[] Assignment 3.
-[] Take a few hours to learn about my exam in June. Should be doable in one library session.

What are my primary worries of my thesis:
-[] Run nomad.
-[] Actually load testing the application of my benchmark.
-[] Starting my writing.

Oh god I can almost feel the end!
