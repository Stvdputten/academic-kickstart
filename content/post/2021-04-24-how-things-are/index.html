<p>Currently when I am bored, I read. If you’d ask my friends, I read a lot. If you ask me, I do. There will always be more extreme examples, but I wake up and read chapters. I go to bed and I read chapters. I spent my weekend reading and doing nothing. That’s why I have a short term book list, which I wanted to read anyways. Around 14 books that have been on my shelve (ereader) way too long. I’ll try to read every one of them. Anyways let’s get on with this weeks new post!</p>
<p>My current collection exists of old books and new books. If a book is simple and can be very visualized I just speed read through it. It doesn’t require much focus and you’ll understand the bigger theme’s anyways. Examples of those books are Starship Trooper and Atomic habits. I keep tabs of those boks on my goodsreads account. I apparently grade lots of books either 4 or 5 stars. Anyways I got around 13 books left. I’ll name a few: 7 habits of highly effective people, the 4-Hour Workweek, Ultralearning, Mindshift. Basically self-help/non-fiction books. If I find them really interesting I save the main ideas in online notes, which I can revisit at anytime. I did that for my last book Atomic Habits.</p>
<p>I also had to help a day at my old tutoring company. Apparently someone got sick. It was a nice change of scenery and a nice day in general, would rate it 9 out of 10. Nostalgic. Furthermore my sister visited once again. She might finally leave the Netherlands to visit her boy friend. Nothing special in general to note about this week. APparently some really nice weather this week.</p>
<p>I was thinking about my current environment (home) and time (student life). I must say I feel like I’m living a relative steady life. I don’t do anything crazy and I feel like I stuck in my own bubble. I feel that’s fine cause I’m currently working on finishing my master’s. Although I do feel like I could do a lot more to explore and feel less anxious about my future and career. I still have the feeling I require some new thing that fills me with passion. I don’t have enough passion right now. Although I wish I could. I also want to change my environment to be with people that are like minded and do stuff similar to me. I want to not feel deviant. It makes me feel singular or maybe a bit lonely at times. Let’s say my environment and time require some work. Where am at and where I am heading?</p>
