<p>As promised I’ll update how my promises of last week went. I had my birthday on Monday. It also seems that the weather will be white for a while. Next week seems to be an easy week so time to get my stuff together.</p>
<p>Well let’s not beat around the bush, here’s my list of promises and if they succeeded:</p>
<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Eat your frogs first</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Workout</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
Stop drinking coffee</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
Stop playing AFK arena</li>
</ul>
<p>I can at least say that 50% ain’t bad. Which means that I’m a work in progress. I do notice that when I woke up in the morning I basically always feel tired. Maybe just a natural thing or a mindset. Still figuring that one out. Getting my dishes done in the morning seems like a nice wake-up routine. I did not do a lot of meditating. I belief working on my mental health might be a goal is need to set. I might be able to set some weekly goals in this post, just like last week.</p>
<p>For my thesis, which is going great so far, I got my research proposal done early. Now I can focus on the actual work of my thesis. Writing a testbed. It seems my first step is to get my test application working in the cloud. Getting the technologies to actually work together might actually be one of the hardest parts. So far I have high hopes for my thesis, so let’s see where the ship may strand.</p>
<p>SO where did I chose to spend my week this time on? I actually got a lot of random visits this week. Even during corona times. I read a few mangas such as Claymore. I almost finished the TV show star wars rebels. I returned all my cloths. I played a little bit of persona 5. Not much exciting things.</p>
<p>One other thing I find interesting is the fact that a friend of mine is most likely dropping his masters after 2.5 years. I can see a lot of mistakes he made in his masters and I see other people making many mistakes during their masters. What I think that most people don’t realize or know how to change is their behavior when necessary. It seems that some students can perform better when necessary than others. Furthermore some recognize their problems but keep making the same mistakes. It’s only human. I’m just curious where to never ending same mistakes, no change mentality comes from. If I belief my books, having a big failure is the best way to make big changes to ones behavior. The fundamental intrinsic motivation change necessary to get people to do and adapt. At the other side of the coin, I’d like to know why some people already have their fundamentals in order or where they got these nice traits from.</p>
<p>Thing I’d like to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stricter diet</li>
<li>Healthier food</li>
<li>Better hygiene</li>
<li>Better gym cloths</li>
<li>Eat my frogs first (and recognize them)</li>
<li>Workout in the morning</li>
</ul>
