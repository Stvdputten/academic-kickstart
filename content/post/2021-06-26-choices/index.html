<p>As you might have noticed, I skipped a week. It’s because I both had to focus on a specific part of my thesis and because there is a casus I had to put my mind to. My supervisor asked if I would be interested in applying for a PhD. At least he told me I would be capable of doing it. Well I’m absolutely stoked to do it, but I took a few days to think about it. My mind keeps switching between following a PhD or simply going into the industry. I’ll discuss my process so far and what I’m planning to improve my informed decision.</p>
<p>My first reaction to my supervisor asking me about my interest in the position: “Hell yeah, that sounds like lots of fun!”. I feel excited and I can’t think of anything else. I called my sister and basically we discussed for an hour, although mostly the negatives. If I’m planning to go to the industry anyways having a PhD is just a career suicide. Not only does it take around 4-6 years to get a PhD. The opportunity costs are probably the most of any PhD. To be an expert in the field of performance reliability of computer science sounds nice, but would I really be happy? So although it sounds great, I had to do more research before I can decide if it would be something for me.</p>
<p>Coincidentally on the same day a friend of mine and I got a drink. So I asked him about his opinion. Given that he’s from a completely different research branch (anthropology), he was very excited about such an offer. He said that it would be really amazing if I took it, because not everyone has such a choice. Furthermore I contacted a friend who’s in the industry, who basically replied: “Well it’s good to have known you”. Implying that it’s a complete suicide. The next day I contacted a study coach of my study, who told me about the pro’s and con’s. At that moment I realized that having a clear idea of how I want my life to be is very important. As such I can make the decision if going to the industry or academia makes more sense. It left me with the question, what would I need to be convinced of doing a PhD?</p>
<p>Confronted with this question I need to perform further steps. My career as an academia guy seems dubious at most. I don’t want to become a professor, but who really knows what your lives calling would be. I believe that growing as an individual is important and as such every path stays open and shouldn’t simply be waived away. I watched some videos about a PhD in the Netherlands and it seems nice enough. I can’t imagine myself being a student that does it a slacky way.</p>
<p>So what am I thinking right now? It seems to be a bad idea. I won’t earn a lot, while I need the money. Maybe in the far future. I don’t like the feeling of having a shortage of money to life myself, nor do I want to reduce my life expectancy by working in a branch that simply destroys your work-life balance. I still have a lot of assumptions about a PhD, but I need to apply to the industry sooner than later. I don’t want to be crawling back after a few years. I need to have my goals straight and know the costs of not going into the industry.</p>
<p>I’ll most likely make a decision within 1-2 weeks, most likely sooner.</p>
