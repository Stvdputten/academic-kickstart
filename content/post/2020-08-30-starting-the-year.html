<p>Tomorrow is the first day of my last year at University Leiden. It still seems like a mess and communication is really bad. We have a mix of lectures, 4 days online and 1 day on campus for the necessary practicals.
As it is my last day of my summer vacation, I’m going to watch some a movie at some friends. I chose 3 courses Distributed Data Processing Systems, Advanced Statistical Computing and Statistical Learning. If I have the motivation I’ll try another course.</p>
<p>On the social side of things I hope my student coaching is going to be fun, starting from Monday I’ll be on active duty and have to prepare the tutoring program. The student coaches haven’t even contacted one another yet, but nobody seems to say anything so I’m assuming nobody is interested in connecting prematurely.
I’ll be keeping updates of interesting things I notice along the way. Expect a lot of rubbish in my first few posts, blogging is new for me.</p>
