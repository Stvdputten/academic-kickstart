<p>A valuable lesson about progression; take it one step at a time. Don’t go too hard, take your time but keep on stepping forward. Why did I bring this up? Well I’ll tell my experience this week about progression.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago I seriously started going back to the gym and exercising more in general. It feels great to exercise and it normally goes hand in hand with more improvements of live. If thing go well I keep stacking up more and more. In my opinion the goal is not about working (hard) and to keep doing these chores of live improvements. It’s more about keeping doing the chores long enough until they feel to be natural. Another phrasing would be to create new habits from these choirs and that’s where I get stuck.</p>
<p>In general if I keep going to the gym, which I call my bare minimum of a healthy life, I’d say I’m doing pretty well. I start to eat healthier (or try), try out new diets, keep a sleep schedule and more more. One of many advice when going to the gym is to just go and not to worry about actual exercises you are performing. However stacking up and stacking up without going used to the previous levels has it’s limits. As a person when following the high of exercising, you want to keep going harder and harder and as results end up feeling tired and requiring extra rest. This rest period – which is not always noticed to be necessary until it’s far to late – stops any habit forming and also goes hand in hand with reducing the amount of chores. One would call this the downward spiral.</p>
<p>This brings me to a few of my insight about this process. For one, I should focus on a few things first and when those are steady (4-6 weeks) and form a habit I can add new things. I should know my limits and take more rest, especially after a period of peeking, the body can’t keep going 24/7 and the mind can only handle so much before being overwhelmed. Finally finding new stuff to improve upon and which “have to be” added to my chores should be handled with care otherwise it might backfire and bring me into a regressive mode.</p>
<p>How did I speed back? I communicated it with the necessary group of people and took a real mental break. No coffee or enhancing the mind to work. Slept earlier and longer for my body to restore. Communicated with my supervisor to get an extra week. Now I try to not get overworked and just relax. Evaluating how my week should look like and what chores I should keep going at and which to drop (or stop to pursue).</p>
<p>If I would name a few causes of my temporary tiredness it would be the combination of (above average) exercising, trying to keep a tight schedule and not taking enough little breaks in-between. A lack of social relaxation, being too goal oriented, etc etc. Let’s if next week will be better after this necessary break.</p>
