<p>Hi, with only a few days remaining in 2020 I want to reflect back a bit. Sorry
for the delay with posting. After my academic work I decided to sit back and enjoy Christmas.</p>
<p>My family came to my place and we had a great time. Great relaxation. Not initially, but my oldest sister kept nagging that I should have prepared better.</p>
<p>The cat is killing me. I stopped feeding it and left it outside. After a few days I tried to let in back in but not feeding it at the same time. Well I’ve never been attacked by a cat so many times in a short time. I got a little bit scared and after a few bites I decided to get some food for the cat. Maybe not the smartest thing, but it kept returning after a few days. I’m assuming it’s hard to get food during the winter and the cat was really in survival mode. I put it on a lost &amp; found website. So let’s hope the cat is found, otherwise it’s going to be a long year.</p>
<p>With the precious time in this vacation I read some books, finished some shows and at a lot of food. I have to think about my goals for coming few months. The end is getting seriously close and I should probably look for what career moves I should make after this. Currently I’m thinking of junior cloud engineer or something like that. While my study is more focused on statistics and data science, so maybe I should pursue that instead.</p>
<p>So only 2 days remaining in this year and it wasn’t spectacular. I got a long list of goals I want to pursue and I set everything up to make sure I’ll achieve everything coming year. Here area few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete Masters</li>
<li>Get a driving license</li>
<li>Find job</li>
<li>Move out of Leiden</li>
<li>Try some new social experiments</li>
<li>Keep this secret diary website alive</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems easy enough, but depending on corona 2021 it might be an interesting year. Have a great 2021 everyone!</p>
