<p>Once again a new Saturday to celebrate. How was your week? Last few days have been great, just having out with lots of friends (yeha I know covid and stuff). So Today I want to talk about being influenced and thinking for yourself and how much I learned. Let’s go straight to the last point.</p>
<p>The goal of these weeklies are to keep track of my mindset throughout the year and actually track a bit of when I learned what. So I noticed I finally feel more comfortable with programming and using all kinds of tools with each other. I wonder how my value stacks when I start working. I got this talk on Friday about being a entrepreneur and stuff. IT people really seem to think being an entrepreneur is like the default way to go, actually a lot of engineering things seems to be that way. Which made my realize that my tutoring company is taking a lot of effort and not rewarding enough. I should probably go do some entrepreneurial activities while I’m still young or follow a Phd. I could only imagine doing it with distributed systems. I have a lot of freedom this year to figure things out.</p>
<p>Anyways for my thesis I started to fool around with a lot of new tech stuff and learn about the jargon (marking talk) of the cool new kids on the block. Here is a list of a lot of cool but vague words:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud native</li>
<li>Serverless</li>
<li>Continuous integration/Continuous delivery</li>
<li>NoOps</li>
<li>Microservices</li>
<li>Funtainers</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically the new Big Data terms. I’m currently reading through some books about it. I hear Cloud native is going to be the new big thing for the coming years. I also remember hearing linux sysops is the worst ever so I won’t go that way. How am I approaching my thesis? I read a lot of books about all kinds of things like Kubernetes and how to apply it and how microservices are orchestrated with it and how to create such containers and images and etc etc. Infrastructure as code with TerraForm, why openFaas is such a big deal. It probably will shape how I do my computations in the future. Development is sooo interesting, however there are not enough hours in the day. I should just go and get a girlfriend now rather than when I’m working in the field. I can easily imagine myself to go the workaholic life style.</p>
<p>Next up, I want to refer back to what I said a few weeks earlier. When the vaccination is here, would I take it or not? I think I would and I’m not sure why. I think the risks are probably worth it and I don’t have to worry about Covid for a while. I do feel influenced by my direct circle of people, because most don’t want to use it or haven’t though about it. It’s not about who’s right or what is correct, people should do what they think is right. This thought experiment made me think about how people are influenced subtly by their direct circle of friends/family. You don’t want to think a lot yourself about though decision and when everyone in your neighborhood says they won’t you also feel inclined to go that way. It feels like your own decision, but actually you haven’t though or looked enough into a complicated subject as this because if everyone in your circle feels a certain way and you trust them with being informed then just follow that consensus. I think the individual person just overestimates how much your direct circle is informed and even if they are how capable they are of correctly interpreting information. You should stay critical and don’t let your own judgement be clouded by your surroundings.</p>
<p>Enjoy your week, I’ll also try to.</p>
