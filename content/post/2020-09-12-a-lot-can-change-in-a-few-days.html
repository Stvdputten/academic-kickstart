<p>Dear reader, I have decided to keep Saturdays as my standard blog day. Sometimes when a lot happens I will post more than once a week as I did this week. There are two things that I would like to talk about especially in this blog, which is work and work. As one might know I currently have two jobs, mentorship at the university and my tutoring company. I’ll discuss both.</p>
<p>I would like to start by saying mentorship is not that hard, however I was let down by my employer. He expects us to work in total for 40 hour for the complete mentorship which translates to 2 hours max a week for a given period of time. This is simply far too low to do proper mentoring. Originally I would work 80 hours. The details aren’t that important, however starting a dialog about the new expected work times is always tiring. As I/we as employees have to defend our case and the employer will defend his case. This takes a strong mental mind to be (1) be sure of your rights (2) the energy to dialog and keep it professional and not personal. This wouldn’t be a problem at all if the guy I was talking to didn’t seem to be such a cold person and my fellow employees would voice their opinion. If we are all in the same boat, it is much easier to argue my case. Well if I have the time this weekend (or starting Monday) I will have to talk about what exactly is in my contract and what are we being paid. Such sensitive topics, which I thought was already clear.</p>
<p>The next experience I had was to let go one of my partners in my tutoring company. He crossed a boundary for the second time. In my mind I have to decide what the consequence should be and how I felt about it. The consequence was to let him go and my other partners agreed. Which let to the way we had to phrase such an conversation. Keeping a healthy personal relationship after having a bad business relationship is new to me. It start with the conversation (basically a firing) and my other partner did the talking, which led to an emotional response of my ex-partner. However the conversation was handled well and I think our personal relationship will be also be fine. One burden dropped at least. I does mean we have to pick-up everything that he left behind. I belief the current partners will lead to a healthy growth and allows our focus once again on the business.</p>
<p>All the talk about business is really tiring. What will next week bring me? FYI, everything felt okay Wednesday because I was starting to get in the flow again now I feel like my back is itching.</p>
