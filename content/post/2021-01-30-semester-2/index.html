<p>Around six months have passed since I started this blog, now my second semester of university is around the block. At least 6 months are needed to complete my master thesis. I have till August. Want to know my honest to god weekly progress? Keep following this blog. Here we go again.</p>
<p>First off I have the vague suspicion that my home is dusty and I only have problems of my dry eyes because of a allergic reaction. Maybe I should check the general practitioner, but at the same time there’s probably not much he can do.</p>
<p>As most are probably aware. The Netherlands is in a state of lockdown, a curfew till 9 o’clock and I have the sad honor of celebrating my birthday. Well I don’t have any wild plans, so most likely it will be me and my sister here. I don’t really care, never been one to celebrate my birthday extensively. Maybe I’ll contact my Indian friend. Furthermore what should I even ask as a present from my sisters. I don’t know.</p>
<p>I started going to the gym again. Without surprise my muscles have been aching the whole week. Literally for days, where one normally would think of maybe two days. I should have probably build up more slowly, who knows. Going serious again after such a long time of inactivity has it’s results. Next to that I do most often try to get myself in a state of flow. This week I would give myself an 8 for the effort. As I think I discussed last week I’m trying to hold the 9 to 17 work days. Things that seem to work are.</p>
<p>Before bed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Briefly write before going to bed what my daily schedule looks like.</li>
<li>Have a mindset before going to bed that I want to wake up or feel enthusiastic.</li>
<li>Keep my mobile phone away from my bedroom.</li>
<li>Write in my gratitude journal.</li>
<li>Read a chapter of a book and use the boredom to fall asleep easily.</li>
<li>Don’t eat too much before or drink coffee or anything that basically keeps you awake, such as a mobile screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Waking up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake up early. I try to wake up 1 hour earlier than my wake-up period.</li>
<li>Drink some water immediately when waking up.</li>
<li>Don’t snooze, rather take powernap during the day to compensate.</li>
<li>Do some easy early easy chores to get in the right state-of-mind, I mostly clean up my house.</li>
<li>Have an early appointment, such as a library appointment, an online meet-up whatever. This forces you to prepare anyways.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I’d like to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat your frogs first thing in the morning.</li>
<li>Workout in the morning or some exercises</li>
<li>Stop drinking coffee (I’ll give an update how this goes next week)</li>
<li>Stop playing AFK Arena. I stopped exactly during the writing of this post.</li>
</ul>
<p>If done right the working during the day and the downtime during the evening really helps my state-of-mind. I do notice not having clear barriers when to work and when to take a break keeps your mind on a state-of-alert as such you are easily tired. I feel less stressed and in a better mood in general. Not sure if it is the downtime, but it sure does feels like it.</p>
<p>Last week of both my jobs ended. I am on a temporary pause of my tutoring company and I just had the last week of my student mentoring. Both on Friday. The former was deliberate so that I can focus on my thesis for a few months, the latter was because the sessions are done. The tutoring doesn’t really require my attention, it runs itself during corona. The mentoring is a little bit sad, the last session ended with a fuss. I did promise to hold a get together if possible in the summer. That would be rather nice. At the same time I’ll miss the random meet-ups with students. My whole world just got a whole lot smaller.</p>
<p>It took a while to get into, but I got into persona 5 royal. Nice game. I get why people are addicted to it. Not sure why it’s a 9 or higher. Maybe the pay-off is that good? Next time I’ll write more about what I do during the day to get motivated. Random thing I’d like to share. Ever bought a pleasure toy for yourself? Well I’m not saying I did just now.</p>
